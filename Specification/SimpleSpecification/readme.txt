What is Specification Pattern? 

Its a design pattern which is used to validate, select or create objects based on certain 
condition and also when we want to maintain the criteria outside the object class.

Lets take an example of Student Object, which has below properties:
a) Name
b) Age
c) Course 
d) YearOfCompletion
e) Grade

We can define a Specification for any of these properties and retrive a object or collection of object or 
create a new object based on the Specification used.
